# EmployeeSummary

## A software engineering team generator application

#
This application prompts user for information about the team manager and then prompts the manager to add employees. Once all team mangers answer questions that are logged the application will create an HTML file called team.html. You will be able to create a nice and neat format for your team roaster like the photos below.
